## CS 380D Distributed Systems (Spring 2020)

Welcome to CS 380D Distributed Systems. This is a course
designed to expose graduate students to the basics of distributed
systems. We will be reading and discussing seminal papers in
distributed systems over the semester. We will also be doing two
projects: an implementation project, and a research project.

Undergrads considering taking this course: this course will be very
different from the traditional undergraduate course. The reading for
each class will be heavy, and there won't be as much lecturing as in
undergraduate classes. The research project will be vague (by
definition). That being said, undergraduate students have previously
taken and excelled in this class. 

This course will introduce students to
  a range of exciting topics including:

- State machines
- Consensus
- Failure detectors
- Distributed Storage Systems
- Byzantine failures
- Lamport clocks
- Snapshots
- Consistency models
- Replication protocols
- MapReduce

and more!

### Grading 

**20%** Midterm-1 <br>
**20%** Midterm-2 <br>
**30%** Project 1: Implementing a distributed key-value store <br>
**30%** Project 2: Research project <br>

### Extra Credit

There are a number of opportunities to earn extra credit. One of the
goals of this class is to get you started in research in distributed
systems. As such, I offer extra credit for working on research and
getting to a feasible submission.

1. If you make a feasible submission to the
[HotCloud](https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud20) workshop by
Mar 17, you get 1% extra credit. If you are attempting this, you need
to get started on your research project early: come talk to me about
this.
2. By the end of the term, if you produce a 12 page paper that is a
feasible submission to OSDI, NSDI, SIGMETRICS, or FAST, you receive 2%
extra credit. Each of these conferences has a different focus. The bar
for a feasible submission at these conferences is quite high, so make
sure you talk to me about it and put in the work!
3. Class surveys. You will receive 0.25% (of the total grade) extra
credit for completing an unofficial survey (before the first
mid-term), and 0.25% for completing an official survey near the end of class.

### Exams

There will be two midterms. There will not be a final exam.

Midterm 1: **Mar 12th** (in-class) <br>
Midterm 2: **May 7th** (in-class, tentatively) <br>

You will be allowed one A4 sheet of paper on which you can bring notes
for the exam. Laptops, tablets, and ereaders are **banned** from
exams. You should not need them in an exam, and they are far too
flexible as communication devices to make enforcement of
non-communication policies enforceable. Any use of a communication
device for any reason in the exam room will earn an automatic zero on
the exam.

### Projects

<p>There will be two big projects in the course. Students will work in
  groups of 2--4 for both projects.</p>

<p>The first project will involve building a distributed key-value
store. More details forthcoming. </p>

<p>The second project is an open-ended research project. The team will
need to extend an existing research project or come up with a new
idea. The team is required to build the prototype, perform
experiments, and write-up a conference style 12 page report.</p>

### Deadlines (tentative)

**Mar 5** Project 1 due <br>
**Mar 12** Midterm 1 <br>
**May 7** Midterm 2 <br>
**May 8--15** Out-of-class presentations about project 2. Scheduled by
appointment<br>
**May 15** Report due about project 2 <br>

### Course Policies

<p>Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/">http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Religious Holy Days</b>: A student who is absent from an
examination or cannot meet an assignment deadline due to the
observance of a religious holy day may take the exam on an alternate
day or submit the assignment up to 24 hours late without penalty, if
proper notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be
given at least 14 days prior to the classes which will be missed. For
religious holy days that fall within the first 2 weeks of the
semester, notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. Notice must be personally delivered to the instructor and
signed and dated by the instructor, or sent certified mail. Email
notification will be accepted if received, but a student submitting
email notification must receive email confirmation from the
instructor.</p>

#### Collaboration 

1. The students are encouraged to do the projects in groups of two or three.
2. All exams are done individually, with absolutely no collaboration.
3. Each student must present.
4. I strongly encourage you to discuss the projects and assignments with
anyone you can. That's the way good science happens. But all work and
writeup for the assignment must be your own, and only your own.
5. As a professional, you should acknowledge significant contributions or
collaborations in your written or spoken presentations.
6. The student code of conduct
is <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/CodeOfConduct.html">here</a>. Intellectual
dishonesty can end your career, and it is your responsibility to stay
on the right side of the line. If you are not sure about something,
  ask.
7. **The penalty for cheating on an exam, project or assignment in
    this course is an F in the course and a referral to the Dean of
    Students office.**
8. You cross over from collaboration to cheating when you look at
    another person/team's source code. **Discussing ideas is okay,
  sharing code is not**.
9. You also may not look at any course project material relating to
  any project similar to or the same as this course's class
  projects. For example, you may not look at the work done by a
  student in past years' courses, and you may not look at similar
  course projects at other universities.
10. All submitted work must be new and original.

#### Late Policy

1. All projects/assignments must be submitted in class the day they
are due.
2. For each day a project/assignment is late, you lose 5% of the
  points for that project. So if you submit two days after the
  deadline, your maximum points on that project will be 90%.
3. In this class, it is always better to do the work (even late) than not
do it at all.
4. If you become ill: contact the instructor. A medical note is
 required to miss an exam.
